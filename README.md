In an effort to help keep you (my customer) updated on things, I’ve thrown together this simple repo with curated, current content. So take a look around the [wiki](https://github.com/stevelange17/AppDev.Health/wiki) and learn more about upcoming events, DevOps at Microsoft, articles, and programs that can help you take advantage of Azure!  I’m completely open to suggestions as well. Let me know of anything you think is missing and I’ll get it added! Just shoot me an email.

As I also start to crank out code nuggets, I'll do my best to share them here.
